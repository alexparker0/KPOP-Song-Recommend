# KPOP-Song-Recommend
Basic discord bot for recommending kpop songs based on the input of spotify song.

# Problems
- Gives 429 error as there are excess and unoptimized requests being sent to the spotify API.
- The song dataset is currently limited to under 300 songs.

# Planned Solutions
- Plan to implement batch processing and caching of song details in order to avoid the first problem.
- Plan to add further songs in the set once the basic features have been established and are working properly.
